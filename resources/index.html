    <br> Wonder Woman was introduced in All Star Comics  (December 1941), during the era known to comics historians as the "Golden Age of Comic Books". Following this debut, 
    she was featured in Sensation Comics  (January 1942), and six months later appeared in her own comic book series (Summer 1942).<br> Wonder Woman took her place beside the extant 
    superheroines or antiheroes Fantomah,[5] Black Widow, Invisible Scarlet O'Neil, and Canada's Nelvana of the Northern Lights. Until his death in 1947, Dr. William Moulton Marston was credited
     with writing all of the Wonder Woman stories. <br>However, later in life, he hired assistant Joye Hummel to ghostwrite stories for him. H. G. Peter penciled the book in a simplistic yet easily identifiable style.<br><br>
     Armed with bulletproof bracelets, a magic lasso, and Amazonian training, Wonder Woman was the archetype of Marston's perfect woman. In Wonder Woman's origin story, Steve Trevor, an intelligence officer in the
      United States Army, crashed his plane on Paradise Island, the Amazons' isolated homeland.<br> Using a "Purple Ray", Princess Diana nursed him back to health and fell in love with him.
       When the goddess Aphrodite declared that it was time for an Amazon to travel to "Man's World" and fight the evil of the Nazis, a tournament was held to determine who would be the Amazon champion. 
       Although forbidden by her mother Queen Hippolyte to participate in the tournament, Princess Diana did so nevertheless, her identity hidden by a mask.<br><br>
